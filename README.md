# Project-C.A.M.I.L.A.
Project C.A.M.I.L.A. is a package that includes Cellular Automata Morphogenesis Intelligence Algorithm and a set of tools to acompany it. 


-	A biologically inspired two-layered sandbox with the intention of producing more organic machine learning behaviour that is reinforced with the principle of backtracking.
-	The two layered sandbox uses cellular automata to model neuron like cells that grow, replicate and die, and a conducting layer.
-	This sandbox can response to inputs and produce outputs and backtracking will be used to encourage/discourage the network.
